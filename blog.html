      <h2>Top 5 Tips for Natural Light Portraits</h2>
      <p>Published on April 15, 2025</p>
      <p><em> Natural light is a photographer’s best friend — when used right. The warmth, the softness, and the depth it adds to portraits can’t be matched by artificial lighting. Here are five tips to help you master it:</em></p>
      <p>
        1. **Golden Hour is Gold** – Shoot during early morning or late afternoon for that golden, diffused glow.<br>
        2. **Use Reflectors** – If shadows are too harsh, use a reflector to bounce light back onto your subject.<br>
        3. **Find Open Shade** – Overhead sunlight can be unflattering. Look for shaded areas that still receive ambient light.<br>
        4. **Backlighting for Mood** – Position your subject with the sun behind them for a dreamy, halo-lit effect.<br>
        5. **Watch the Eyes** – Natural light should bring out catchlights in the subject’s eyes — this is where emotion shines through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment, observe, and practice — every lighting situation teaches you something new!

      <h2>Behind the Scenes: Wedding in Tuscany</h2>
      <p>Published on May 25, 2025</p>
      <p><em> Last month, I had the joy of capturing a dreamy wedding set among the vineyards of Tuscany. From golden sunset shots to candlelit dinner moments, every frame told a love story.</em></p>
      <p>
        The ceremony took place in a 15th-century villa surrounded by olive trees and rolling hills. The couple wanted a natural, documentary style — so I focused on raw emotion and spontaneous laughter, rather than posed portraits.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite moments? The groom wiping a tear as the bride walked down the aisle, backlit by the soft Italian sun. Magic.
